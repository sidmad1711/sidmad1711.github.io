Hi! I am a Cybersecurity Master's student at Georgia Tech.
With a strong background in Web Application Penetration Testing, Secure Code Review, Offensive Security, Threat Modelling, and Incident Response, I am interested in identifying vulnerabilities, conducting comprehensive security assessments, and implementing proactive security measures. I am committed to staying ahead of evolving cyber threats to safeguard critical systems and data.
